    <h1>My Quest for Wisdom</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Chapter One: HTML basics</h2>
        <h3>23.11.2021</h3>
        <p>Hello World! My name is Rick, I work as a Quality Engineer in a production plant, but I decided to broaden my skillset by learning something completely new.
          My goal is to become an employable programmer focused on building fast and responsive websites.</p>
        <p>I stumbled upon a free course called The Odin Project (hence the name of this site), and I liked the way it was presented, so I gave it a shot.</p>
        <p>To be fair, I already have some IT education (vocational school), and I grew up with computers, so most of the beginner concepts were clear to me from the start, but I still had to learn 
          how to set up Ubuntu (dual boot), Git/GitHub and VSCode.</p>
        <p>I found VSCode to be a very powerful tool, and most of the things the course requires me to use the terminal for, I could do in VSCode by clicking on buttons.
          We will see if I change my approach in the future.</p>
        <p>My plan with this site is to document my progress by updating it with new things I learn, and adding a snapshot of the current state at the end of every chapter.</p>
      <h3>The state of the site at the time of writing this:</h3>

    <h2>Chapter Two: Adding CSS</h2>
    <h3>25.11.2021</h3>
    <p>In this chapter I am focusing on CSS and I'm going to do my best to make the site readable and easy to digest.</p>
    <p>CSS can be applied inline (not recommended), internal (inside the html file, also not recommended), or external (for example styles.css, this is what I will focus on)</p>
    <p>Things to note while learning CSS:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>using ID and class elements</li>
        <li>using and combining selectors to apply rules</li>
        <li>learning about the specificity of selectors</li>
        <li>learning about inheritance</li>
    </ul>
