    <h1>My Quest for Wisdom</h1>
    <h2>Chapter One</h2>
    <h3>22.11.2021</h3>
    <p>Hello World! My name is Rick, I work as a Quality Engineer in a production plant, but I decided to broaden my skillset by learning something completely new.
        My goal is to become an employable programmer focused on building fast and responsive websites.</p>
    <p>I stumbled upon a free course called The Odin project (hence the name of this site), and I liked the way it was presented, so I gave it a shot.</p>
    <p>To be fair, I already have some IT education (vocational school), so most of the beginner concepts were clear to me from the start, but I still had to learn 
        how to set up Ubuntu (dual boot), Git/GitHub and VSCode.</p>
    <p>I found VSCode to be a very powerful tool, and most of the things the course requires me to use the terminal for, I could do in VSCode by clicking on buttons.
        We will see if I change my approach in the future.</p>
    <p>My plan with this site is to document my progress by updating it with new thins I learn, and adding a snapshot of the current state at the end of every chapter.</p>
    <h3>The state of the site at the time of writing this:</h3>
