  <h1>My Quest for Wisdom</h1>
  <div>
    <h2 class="chapter">Chapter One: HTML basics</h2>
    <h4 class="date">23.11.2021</h3>
      <p>Hello World! My name is Rick, I work as a Quality Engineer in a production plant, but I decided to broaden my
        skillset by learning something completely new.
        My goal is to become an employable programmer focused on building fast and responsive websites.</p>
      <p>I stumbled upon a free course called The Odin Project (hence the name of this site), and I liked the way it was
        presented, so I gave it a shot.</p>
      <p>To be fair, I already have some IT education (vocational school), and I grew up with computers, so most of the
        beginner concepts were clear to me from the start, but I still had to learn
        how to set up Ubuntu (dual boot), Git/GitHub and VSCode.</p>
      <p>I found VSCode to be a very powerful tool, and most of the things the course requires me to use the terminal
        for, I could do in VSCode by clicking on buttons.
        We will see if I change my approach in the future.</p>
      <p>My plan with this site is to document my progress by updating it with new things I learn, and adding a snapshot
        of the current state at the end of every chapter.</p>
      <h3>The state of the site at the time of writing this:</h3>

    <h2 class="chapter">Chapter Two: Adding CSS</h2>
    <h4 class="date">25.11.2021</h3>
      <p>In this chapter I am focusing on CSS and I'm going to do my best to make the site readable and easy to digest.
      </p>
      <p>CSS can be applied inline (not recommended), internal (inside the html file, also not recommended), or external
        (for example styles.css, this is what I will focus on)</p>
      <p>Things to note while learning CSS:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a
            href="https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/css-foundations#selectors">using
            selectors</a></li>
        <li>combining selectors to apply rules</li>
        <li>learning about the specificity of selectors</li>
        <li>learning about inheritance</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The built-in inspect tool of my browser was a huge help while figuring out what the different css commands did
        (especially margin, padding, border).
        Using it on sites I like inspired me to make something similar.
      </p>

    <h2 class="chapter">Chapter Three: Javascript basics and DOM manipulation</h2>
    <h4 class="date">12.12.2021</h3>
      <p>It's getting complicated! I'm on my way to finishing the Javascript fundamentals course, which focuses on
        getting to know the syntax, conditionals,
        loops, solving complex problems step by step, and also modifying the HTML and CSS that I learned earlier.
      </p>
      <p>One of the projects was to make a Rock Paper Scissors game, which you can find and play under this paragraph
      </p>
      <div id="rps">
        <div id="buttons">
        <button id="rock">Rock</button>
        <button id="paper">Paper</button>
        <button id="scissors">Scissors</button>
        </div>
        <div class="results">
          <p class="lastGame">-</p>
          <p id="yourScore">Your score: 0</p>
          <p id="computerScore">Computer score: 0</p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <p>I also wanted to make a night mode for this site, try it out:</p>
